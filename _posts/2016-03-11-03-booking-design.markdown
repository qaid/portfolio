title: Reduced Cognitive Load & Increased Conversions
description: |
---
To speed users through the funnel and encourage confidence in their decision making, I designed flows and UI at Booking.com.

To minimize information overload and highlight the most appropriate selections in a crowded view, I studied user research and common patterns to design effective visual artifacts. Working with copywriters, back-end developers, and other designers, I used iterative design approaches, A/B testing, and multivariate testing to increase conversions on the site.
