To achieve the aims of the human rights campaigns launched by the [Center for Constitutional Rights](http://ccrjustice.org), I produced physical and digital media that told compelling stories designed to inspire action.

As the Web & Multimedia Manager, working with tight deadlines, limited resources, and a large staff with diverse (and sometimes competing) needs, I coded and launched websites and email campaigns, designed publications, produced and edited video, and implemented technological infrastructure to manage the organization's creative assets.
