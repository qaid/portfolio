**I designed physical and digital media that told compelling stories designed to inspire action.** 

As the Web & Multimedia Manager the Center for Constitutional Rights, I worked with tight deadlines, limited resources, and a large staff with diverse (and sometimes competing) needs. I coded and launched websites and email campaigns, designed publications and posters, produced and edited video, and implemented technological infrastructure to manage the organization's creative assets.
