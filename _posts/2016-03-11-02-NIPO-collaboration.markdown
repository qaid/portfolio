To leverage the creative drives and social connections between my colleagues at [NIPO Software](http://niposoftware.com), I established and promoted tools and opportunities for collaboration.

To take advantage of the innovative but often out-of-scope product ideas that most everyone had, and to have some fun, I introduced and organized the company's periodic hackathon event. To reduce the friction of sharing information within the company, I implemented and shepherded the adoption of a Slack team. To encourage better communication and rethinking of our conclusions, I made a space for all of our writing by coding and launching the internal blog.
