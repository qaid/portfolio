**I lead Design Sprints, started the company Hackathon, organized the adoption of Slack, and launched the company blog**

To leverage the creative drives and social connections between my colleagues at NIPO Software, I started the company hackathon. To encourage a more active culture of communication, I organized the adoption of Slack across development, product management, marketing, sales, and support departments. To refine and prioritize years of product innovation ideas from all corners of the company, I lead design sprints and discovery sessions. To encourage the sharing and rethinking of our conclusions, I made a space for all of our writing by coding and launching the internal blog.
