title: Redesign of a Flagship Product
description: |
---
To access new markets and speed development of NIPO Software's flagship product, Nfield Manager, we decided to overhaul its look & feel and transition to a different front end and routing Framework.

To refine and prioritize years of product innovation ideas from all corners of the company, I lead design sprints and discovery sessions. To determine the best direction for the product's visual design, I synthesized the best bits of popular dashboards. To make the design-to-development process efficient, I made interactive prototypes and coded finalized solutions into a living style guide.
