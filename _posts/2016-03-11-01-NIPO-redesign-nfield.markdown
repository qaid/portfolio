**I built a dynamic style guide to extend the discussion around design and make the build process more efficient.**

At NIPO Software, a complex build process was taking away focus on the front end of their dashboard app. The pace caused a pile-up of great product ideas at NIPO Software. As the UX Designer, I was anxious to improve the interfaces and work flows.

To make space for those ideas, we decided to change to an Ember front-end, which would allow greater speed and get more UI and workflow ideas into the product. I designing layouts that clarified customer workflows and improved accessibility.
