title: Redesign of a Flagship Product
description: |
---
At NIPO Software, a complex build process was taking away focus on the front end. It caused a pile-up of great product ideas at NIPO Software. As the UX Designer, I was also anxious to improve the interfaces and work flows.

To make space for those ideas, we decided to change to an Ember front-end, which would allow greater speed and get more and more workflow ideas into the product. While designing layouts that clarified customer workflows and improved accessibility, I built a dynamic style guide to extend the discussion around design and make the build process more efficient.
