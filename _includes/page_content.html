                  <p>To refine and prioritize years of product innovation ideas from all corners of the company, I lead design sprints and discovery sessions. These resulted in a collection of prioritized product ideas, that I then turned into low fidelity but clickable prototypes. I shared my prototypes with the entire company, hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I delivered iterated prototypes to the development teams and helped to tweak the outcome through conversation and experimentation during the build process.</p>

                  <p>My visual direction for the product was a synthesis of the best bits of popular dashboards; embracing Google's material design approach, the interface is spartan and utilitarian, without clutter ushering users through their tasks.</p>

                  <p>To efficiently maintain a singular and unified source of styling and interaction patterns, I coded a living style guide based on the open source Fabricator project. I've written a bit about the challenges of <a href="https://medium.com/qa-id-jacobs/turning-engineers-into-dj-s-a53409b622">implementing a living style guide</a> as well as an uncommon git strategy I leveraged for having a <a href="https://medium.com/qa-id-jacobs/adorable-nesting-repos-31a1ed3b13f5"> distributed style library in multiple products</a> across the company portfolio.</p>

                  <p>When I first started working at NIPO Software, I tried to get up to speed with all of the design and innovation thinking that took place before I came onboard. I asked about the notes and results of the most recent hackathon, knowing that some of the most interesting product ideas will come from hackathons. I discovered that there had never been a hackathon. I set out to introduce and organized the company's periodic hackathon event.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <p>I wrote a one-pager for management that extolled the financial and cultural benefits of a hackathon and mapped out how the processes leading up to and including the event would work with me as the leader. In 2 years we had three hackathons that were successes in both innovation and fun departments.</p>
                  <p>Continuing my efforts to reduce the friction of sharing information within the company, I implemented and shepherded the adoption of a Slack team. To encourage better communication and rethinking of our conclusions, I made a space for all of our writing by coding and launching the internal blog. Whenever I join an organization, I try to elevate the practice of writing; <a href="https://medium.com/@qaidj/why-bother-writing-about-your-development-and-design-work-4b5071aa0a05">I wrote about it on Medium</a> recently.</p>
